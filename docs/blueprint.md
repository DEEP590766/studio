## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL shifts toward a gentle blue, like #718096, offering a sense of tranquility.
- Background color: a very light desaturated near-white from the primary hue (#F0F3F5).
- Accent color: a more saturated blue #4A5568, which offers greater visual interest while keeping an emphasis on readability and neutrality.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, given the UI's simplicity. Neutral styling will also allow your demo users to read on-screen directions and get a better understanding of your prompt to the LLM.
